    <p>Explore diving in Jordan
        The main attraction for divers is Jordan’s southernmost tip where the Red Sea’s tropical waters bathe some of the most spectacular coral reefs in the world. 
        While the total coastline is only about 27 km long, there are plenty of dive sites to choose from - many of them located within Aqaba Marine Park.
        Here divers enjoy a wide variety of soft and hard coral and myriad reef fish.
        Most of the 20+ sites are accessible from the shore.
        The variety of dive sites available along Jordan's small coast will surprise many.
        These include wrecks and a gorgeous reef dive that everyone can enjoy.
        The black coral has grown from 5 to 40m and is now home to hawksbill turtles, eagle rays and a variety of reef fish.
        Divers have the chance to interact with feather tail stingrays and pygmy slug nudibranchs.</p>
